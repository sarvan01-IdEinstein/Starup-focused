// This file is now deprecated - services have been split into individual files
// Use individual service files in lib/services/ for easier maintenance

// For backward compatibility, re-export the combined services data
export { servicesData } from "@/lib/services";

// You can also import individual services directly:
// import { cad_modeling, research_development } from "@/lib/services";
