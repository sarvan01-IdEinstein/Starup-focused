## ðŸŽ­ **ANIMATION STANDARDS**

### **Consistent Patterns:**
```tsx
// Page Load Animation
initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 30 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
transition={{ duration: 0.8 }}

// Staggered Elements
transition={{ duration: 0.6, delay: index * 0.1 }}

// Hover Effects
whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
transition={{ type: 'spring', stiffness: 300 }}

// Background Elements (Subtle)
animate={{ y: [-20, 20, -20] }}
transition={{ duration: 8, repeat: Infinity }}
```

### **Animation Guidelines:**
- **Subtle and purposeful** - Enhance UX, don't distract
- **Consistent timing** - 0.6s for elements, 0.8s for sections
- **Performance focused** - Smooth animations, no jank
- **Brand appropriate** - Professional, not playful
