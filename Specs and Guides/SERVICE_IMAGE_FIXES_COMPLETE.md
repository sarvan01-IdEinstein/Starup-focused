# Service Image Path Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Next.js 15 Async Params Issue ✅
- **Problem**: Service pages were using synchronous `params.slug` instead of awaiting params
- **Fix**: Updated `app/services/[slug]/page.tsx` to properly await params in both the main component and generateMetadata function

### 2. Service Hero Image Paths ✅
- **Problem**: ServiceDetails component was constructing wrong paths using category names
- **Fix**: Added `getServiceHeroImage()` helper function with correct service-to-directory mapping:
  ```typescript
  const servicePathMap: Record<string, string> = {
    "research-development": "engineering/research-development",
    "cad-modeling": "design/cad-modeling",
    "3d-printing": "manufacturing/3d-printing",
    "machine-design": "engineering/machine-design",
    "biw-design": "engineering/biw-design",
    "finite-element-cfd": "engineering/finite-element-cfd",
    "gdt-tolerance": "engineering/gdt-tolerance",
    "technical-documentation": "design/technical-documentation",
    "supplier-sourcing": "manufacturing/supplier-sourcing"
  };
  ```

### 3. Process Step Image Paths ✅
- **Problem**: ProcessFlow component was using wrong category-based paths
- **Fix**: Added `getProcessStepImage()` helper function that uses the same service-to-directory mapping

### 4. Step Title Mappings ✅
Fixed all service step mappings to match actual step titles in services data:

#### CAD Modeling Service
- ✅ "Requirements Analysis" → "ED-1-requirements"
- ✅ "Concept Development" → "ED-2-concept-sketching"  
- ✅ "Detailed 3D Modeling" → "ED-3-3d-modeling"
- ✅ "Assembly Modeling" → "ED-4-assembly-modeling"
- ✅ "Technical Documentation" → "ED-5-technical-drawings"
- ✅ "Review & Revision" → "ED-6-review-revision"
- ✅ "Design Handover" → "ED-7-final-documentation"

#### 3D Printing Service
- ✅ "Design Review" → "TP-1-design-review"
- ✅ "File Preparation" → "TP-2-file-preparation"
- ✅ "Printer Selection" → "TP-3-printer-selection"
- ✅ "Material Selection" → "TP-4-material-selection"
- ✅ "Printing Process" → "TP-5-printing-process"
- ✅ "Post-Processing" → "TP-6-post-processing"
- ✅ "Quality Control" → "TP-7-quality-control"

#### GD&T & Tolerance Analysis Service
- ✅ "Design Review" → "GT-1-design-review"
- ✅ "Tolerance Analysis" → "GT-2-manufacturing-method" (directory mismatch fixed)
- ✅ "GD&T Implementation" → "GT-3-gdt-implementation"

#### Supplier Sourcing Service
- ✅ "Requirements Definition" → "SS-1-requirements-definition"
- ✅ "Supplier Identification" → "SS-3-supplier-identification" (directory mismatch fixed)
- ✅ "Qualification & Onboarding" → "SS-7-supplier-onboarding" (directory mismatch fixed)

#### Technical Documentation Service
- ✅ Already correctly mapped to match existing directories

#### R&D Service
- ✅ Already working correctly (was fixed in previous session)

#### Machine Design & BIW Design Services
- ✅ Already correctly mapped

#### FEA & CFD Service
- ✅ Already correctly mapped

## Directory Structure Confirmed

All services now correctly point to their actual directory locations:

```
public/images/services/
├── engineering/
│   ├── research-development/ ✅
│   ├── finite-element-cfd/ ✅
│   ├── machine-design/ ✅
│   ├── biw-design/ ✅
│   └── gdt-tolerance/ ✅
├── design/
│   ├── cad-modeling/ ✅
│   └── technical-documentation/ ✅
└── manufacturing/
    ├── 3d-printing/ ✅
    └── supplier-sourcing/ ✅
```

## Result

All service pages should now display:
- ✅ Service hero images correctly
- ✅ Process step images correctly  
- ✅ No more 404 errors for missing images
- ✅ Proper Next.js 15 compatibility

The image path construction is now centralized and consistent across both ServiceDetails and ProcessFlow components.
