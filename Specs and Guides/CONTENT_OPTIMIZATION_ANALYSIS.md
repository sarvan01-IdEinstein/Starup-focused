4. **Vague Mission**: Doesn't highlight specific engineering expertise
5. **Missing Differentiators**: No mention of specific industries, technologies, or unique approaches
6. **Team Section**: Only 2 members with generic bios
7. **No Client Focus**: Doesn't address specific client pain points

### **Hero Section - Current Issues:**
1. **Generic Tagline**: "Where Ideas Take Shape" - could apply to any company
2. **No Value Proposition**: Doesn't explain what IdEinstein specifically does
3. **Missing Credibility**: No social proof, certifications, or specific achievements
4. **Weak CTA Context**: Buttons don't explain the value of consultation/quotation
